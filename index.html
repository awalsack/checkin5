<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Kitty Cat and I am a kitty cat, but sometimes I forget I am a kitty cat.</p>
<p>One day it was snowing really hard and I was really cold so I hid in a garage. I was hungry and cold and I wasn't feeling very well. Then, some nice people found me, wrapped me in a snuggly blanket, and took me into their home.</p>
<p>Now I am very fat and I live with my mommy in her apartment at Virginia Tech. I was not very happy with her when she put me in a car for a very long time to take me here, but I'm okay with it now and I haven't peed on any of the furniture...yet.</p>
